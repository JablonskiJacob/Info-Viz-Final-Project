What is the project?
My final project for my class Intro to Information Visualization. This project looks into one of the reasons of the MLB Lockout, which was player salaries and the 
changes throughout the past CBA. I chose to focus on aspects like average and median player salary along with team payrolls versus their revenue in a given year. 
Money was and will continue to be a bigger and bigger issue inside professional sports and MLB specifically. This project was to show the trend of teams making more 
and more money while paying their players less. At the time of making this, a new CBA has been agreed to and baseball is being played again. Most players were happy 
but there was still some slight disagreement within the Players Association. There is hope that players will continue to be paid more and that these issues will soon 
no longer be an issue. This projects visualizes some of these issues and tries to give a better understanding of what happens. 

How to use?
This project is run by GitHub pages and you can view it by heading to the html file hosted by GitHub. There is no installation required as it runs just like any 
other website using html, js, and css. It uses the D3 JS library but this doesn't require any extra steps to use. You can view the project website being hosted at

Lessons learned?
I think I learned a lot about various things will completing this class and project. To start off with, I learned a lot more about HTML and javascript. These two 
topics were pretty unfamiliar to me and this class helped me to become a lot more familiar with them. I have also learned a lot about graphs and visualizations. 
There is a lot of small things that needed to be learned and I never really thought of when looking at graphs. In terms of this project, I learned a lot more about
MLB salaries and Team revenues. I also learned how much data can truly be needed to make large visualizations and projects that are properly done in real world 
projects. Overall I learned a lot about visualizations in this class and learned a lot more during this final project.
