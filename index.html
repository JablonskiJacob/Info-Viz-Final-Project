        <h2>Average MLB Player Salary</h2>
        <p>
          The average salary of a MLB player has increased a lot since the early 2000s. This is rather similar to other sports leagues
          and makes sense with the increase in TV deals and other money making aspects of MLB and the teams. However the average player 
          salary is not the best way to judge if players are making more or less. In 2021, the top 50 players were being paid 33.4% of 
          the total player salaries and the top 100 players were receiving 52.4% of all the salaries. This means that the increase in the 
          average salary doesn't really mean all players are getting paid more. This increases becauses of contracts like Mike Trout, 
          Gerrit Cole, and Nolan Arenado who are all making over $35M a year.

        <h2>Median MLB Player Salary</h2>
        <p>
          I think that the median salary of a MLB players shows a more clear picture of what has been happening in the league more recently. 
          The big contracts mentioned before like Mike Trout and Gerrit Cole really increase the average salary but there are still a lot of 
          player who don't get paid anywhere near those amounts. The median salary has dropped nearly 30% since its record-high in 2015. In 2021, 
          62% of players on opening day rosters had a salary of under $1M and 35% had a salary under $600,000. The last Collective Bargaining Agreement
          (CBA) had the lowest minimum salary of the 4 major sports in the USA. In the recent lockout, the Players Association (MLBPA) wanted the CBA
          to drastically improve this number.
